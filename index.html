Dear <strong>my love</strong>

<strong>Happy 2nd anniversary!</strong>

Sometimes I don’t even know where to begin, because my thoughts start and end with you. Every direction I turn somehow leads back to you, every view, every quiet moment, every thought in between. Even when I’m sinking, even when my mind is loud, it is always you I think of. Morning and night, again and again, you are there. Your eyes, your smile, your laughter, you are written into every chapter of my life, and I would reread every page just to feel you all over again.

In the middle of my chaos, there is gratitude. Gratitude for your presence, for your love, and for the way you support me even when things are heavy. In a world that often feels overwhelming, you are my safe haven, my calm within the storm. You are my light, the kind that doesn’t blind, but gently guides.

I love the small things, too. I love wanting to cook for you. I love wanting your plate in front of mine, like a quiet promise that we’re always sharing the same table, the same space, the same life. I love imagining all the “many mores”, more days, more laughs, more ordinary moments that become special just because they’re with you.

Our journey hasn’t been perfect. We’ve fought. We’ve misunderstood each other. There were moments when we almost failed each other, moments when we almost walked away. We stood at the edge more than once. But somehow, every time, we never fail to find our way back. When we’re on the verge of breaking, we choose each other again. And that, to me, is love in its truest form.

I fell in love with you in so many ways. I fell in love with the way you think, the way you talk, the way you walk through the world. I fell in love with the way you breathe, the way you care, the way you love so deeply. I fell in love with your perfectly crafted design, inside and out. I fell in love with you in infinite ways, and that means I will always have infinite reasons to love you.

So today, on our second anniversary, I want you to know this: I promise that this will be worth it. I promise to make things worth it. To choose you, to grow with you, to fight for us even when it’s hard. There is nothing better than resting at ease knowing you are here for me and I hope you always feel how deeply I am here for you, too.

I love you always and in many ways mahal ko, pipiliin kita palagi, at hindi ako nauubusan ng rason para mahalin ka araw-araw.  Each star equates to every reason why I love you, and every grain of sand equates to how many times I want to show you my love. And in every multiverse, in every lifetime and every version of me, I would still find you, still choose you, and still fall in love with you all over again.

With all my love—Always yours,

<strong>Austin</strong>, your honeyboo.
