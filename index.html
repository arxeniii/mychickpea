Dear love,

How are you my love, it’s the end of the year now and tomorrow will be our 23rd monthsary. We’ve come a long way, this year was a rollercoaster ride, it was full of memories, emotions, lover’s quarrel, jokes, but after all of those, it is full of love. We’ve come a long way, and for sure we will conquer many more years forever.

I am writing this letter to thank you for all the efforts, perseverance, and for everything that you have done to me, especially for loving me unconditionally. I appreciate you so much, and you will always be the best thing that has ever happened to me, you inspired me and motivated me in everything that I do. You are the reason why I have what I have now. You are the reason for who I am. And you are behind every success that I have.

You are there always, in my highest and in my lowest and I will always be grateful because I always have you and you never leave me alone.

I want you, and I’ll always will, I love you and that’ll never fade. As the new year comes, a monthsary also commences the same day, and it feels so special knowing that we get to welcome a new year while celebrating another month of us. It reminds me that every beginning is better when I get to share it with you.

As the year changes, my promise stays the same, to choose you every day, to grow with you, to be patient, to understand, and to love you even more deeply than before. I look forward to more cuddles, making love, more silly moments, more challenges we’ll face hand in hand, and more dreams we’ll slowly turn into reality together.

Thank you for being my home, my comfort, my safe place in a world that can sometimes be too loud and too heavy. Thank you for believing in me even when I doubt myself, for holding my hand when I’m scared, and for loving me in ways I never knew I needed. No matter what the new year brings, I know I am ready for it because I have you beside me.

Here’s to another month, another year, and a lifetime of love, growth, and togetherness. Happy 23rd monthsary, my chickpea, and happy new year to us. I can’t wait to experience everything with you, today, tomorrow, and always. I love you more than this universe can expand my love, I want you more than any blue sky. Mahal na mahal kita.

With all my love—Always yours,

Austin, your honeyboo.
